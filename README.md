# The Kill Switch

## Project Overview

"The Kill Switch" is a Python-based tool that automates the shutdown of AWS EC2 instances across a region, filtering by specific department tags. The project integrates with AWS API Gateway, allowing users to trigger the shutdown process via a POST method, passing the relevant tags directly to the script.

## Features

- **Automated EC2 Shutdown**: Efficiently locates and shuts down EC2 instances in a specified AWS region.
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Targets instances based on department-specific tags, enabling precise control over which instances are affected.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Leverages AWS API Gateway for initiating the shutdown process, making it accessible and manageable remotely.
- **Scalability and Security**: Designed with cloud best practices in mind, ensuring scalability and security.
